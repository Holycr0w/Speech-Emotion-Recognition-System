# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System

This Code focuses on developing a robust Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using a deep learning-based approach. By integrating multiple datasets (RAVDESS, CREMA-D, TESS, SAVEE) and leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with advanced data augmentation techniques, the model achieved a high accuracy of 96.88%. This system generalizes well across diverse datasets and real-world conditions, addressing challenges like the variability of emotional expressions. The project demonstrates applications in human-computer interaction, customer service, and mental health monitoring, showcasing an adaptable and efficient deep learning solution for emotion detection from speech signals.
